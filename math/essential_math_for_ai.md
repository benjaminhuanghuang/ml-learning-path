## Algebra Fundamentals
- linear equations
- intercepts X and Y, and slop

## Quadratic Equations and Functionse

## Differential Calculus 
- Rates of change
- Limits: is the value that a function (or sequence) "approaches" as the input (or index) infinitesimally close some value.
- Derivative: the **limit of the slope** equation as h(delt x) approaches 0
- Differentiation / Differentiability / Differentiable
    Differentiation is the action of computing a derivative.
    To be differentiable at a given point, the function must be continuous at that point, the tangent line at that point cannot be vertical, and the line must be smooth at that point - in other words it can't take on a sudden change of direction. 

A common use of calculus is to find the minimum and maximum points in a function.

- prime derivative / second-order derivative
    we call the derivative of the function its prime derivative, and the derivative of the prime derivative is the second-order derivative
- Optimizing Functions: using critical point and second-order derivative
- Multivariate Differentiation / partial derivatives
    finding the derivatives for changes in the function with respect to x or y, and we call these
partial derivatives. 

- Integration / integral of function

 - antiderivative of F of x: a function whose derivative is F of x

## Liner algebra
- Vector 
    Vectors describe spatial lines and planes
    polar coordinate / Cartesian coordinate
- Vector operation
    - scalar multiplication: multiply each element of the vector by the scalar
    - dot product of two vectors: multiply the corresponding elements of the vectors and add the results
    - cross product of two vector

- Matrix and operation
    - Add / subtract
    - transpose (switch col and row)
    - Mulitplication
    - Identity Matrix: equivalent in matrix terms of the number 1


- Statistics 
    - qualitative / categorical
    - nominal / ordinal
    - continuous / discrete

- Probability
To calculate the probability, we divide the number of sample points that result in the event, by the total number of sample points in sample space..g
